Lecture Notes / Slides
==============================================

These lecture notes contains some special OPE RISE slides layouts that the Open Education Project supports.

Please note that the example slidedeck may appear to be displaying incorrectly. This is because these cells are meant to be run in slideshow mode using Jupyter's RISE extension so that students may access the slides right in their Jupyter environment. This is meant to be an example of what is possible using RISE. For more accurate output, open up ln_part1/ch1.ipynb in Jupyter with the RISE extension enabled and view it in slideshow mode.
